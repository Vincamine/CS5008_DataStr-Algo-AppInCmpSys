Who did you work with?
Myself and the universe.
And my left hand, my right hand, my stomach, my muscles, my fingers, my hairs, my eyes.
My cat who leaves in LA.
And the soul of Hedy Lamarr.
Maybe the ghost of my hedgehog.
Forgot. Forgot I had an assignment. Forgot I exist. Forgot the universe exists.

How long did this take you?
Honestly, based on my timeline, I solved it faster than lightning but slower than the of birth of a humpback whale.
